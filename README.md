# trub
- fetch ubuntu cloud image
- commit the rootfs to an ostree repo
- create full delta to apply to any repo, and partial delta to apply to repos having a previous version.

###### notes
This image does not have booting capabilities, for that there is [pine](https://github.com/untoreh/pine).

It is used for a couple of container based apps based on ubuntu.
